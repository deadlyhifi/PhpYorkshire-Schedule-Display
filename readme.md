# Conference Schedule Display

This was originally made for PHP Yorkshire 2017 to show a live updating display of the current and upcoming talks on the various TVs around the venue.

The schedule is set in `src/schedule.json`.

Itâ€™s made in React JS. Do an `npm install` and an `npm start` to see it in action.
